    //Safe Methods

    // Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow the
    // user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an unexpected significance to themselves or others.

    // In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than
    // retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a
    // special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.

    // Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some
    // dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore
    // cannot be held accountable for them.


    //Idempotent Methods

    // Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request.
    // The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent.

    //However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non-idempotent, even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are idempotent.
    //(A sequence is idempotent if a single execution of the entire sequence always yields a result that is not changed by a reexecution of all, or part, of that sequence.)
    //For example, a sequence is non-idempotent if its result depends on a value that is later modified in the same sequence.

    //A sequence that never has side effects is idempotent, by definition (provided that no concurrent operations are being executed on the same set of resources).
